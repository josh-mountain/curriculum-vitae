		<h3>Awards:</h3><p>
	         <ul>

	<p>During my DoFE Award, I participated in a 30km hike and completed
	the necessary 3 months of voluntary, of which I helped disabled
	children learn to read and write; 3 months learning a new skill
	which was replacing the bottom bracket of a mountain bike which
	had snapped; and 6 months doing a physical activity in athletics.</p>

		<h3>Additional Information:</h3>
	<p>I have made Virtual Machines using Virtual Box with the following
	      Operating Systems:</p>
          <ul>
	<li>Kali Linux</li>
	<li>MacOS</li>
	<li>Windows 3.1</li>
	<li>Windows 95</li>
	<li>Windows 98</li>

	<li>Windows Server 2016 for the purpose of active directory.</li>
	  </ul>

	<br>I was able to make an admin account upon setup and set the background
	in a user account I made using AD in the admin account. I also setup
	RAID 1 and 5 for using the server I built in Australia with 8 disks
	and 32GB of RAM.<p>
